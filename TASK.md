Eriwan is a podcast hosting application. 

It will work with two kinds of users: visitors and administrators. Visitors can add podcast episodes (as audio files).  Administrators can add plain text intermissions between the episodes (jokes about Armenian radio). Our application should collect all episodes, convert the jokes from text into audio files and build an rss/atom feed for podcast listeners where random jokes are inserted after each episode.

Bonus tasks:
* Add a jingle before and after ‘Armenian joke’ part
* Add a voice announcement with the name of the episode before it starts
